# Express.js and Backend Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Express.js and Backend Learning Repository**! This repository contains all my code, projects, and experiments related to learning backend development with Express.js and JavaScript. It serves as a collection of resources, examples, and practice code for mastering backend technologies.

## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing backend development, primarily focusing on **Express.js**, a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js. Here, you will find practical implementations, demos, and projects as I progress through backend concepts.

### Key Highlights:

- Implementation of RESTful APIs using Express.js.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with example endpoints.
- Middleware usage for parsing JSON, handling errors, and more.
- Step-by-step examples as part of my backend learning journey.
- Real-world use cases to reinforce backend development concepts.
- Backend tools, patterns, and best practices.
- Tutorials and notes on authentication, database integration, and performance optimization.
